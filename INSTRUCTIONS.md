Biggest takeaways:

This was more challenging, developing a method to get the pairs, and using sockets with a 
combination of debounced data to make sure the server doesn't get overloaded with requests.
The hardest part was communicating the sockets between the input on the ListItem and the 
data fetching of the main page.

3) Front end concepts 

Instructions on how to run.

Biggest takeaways:

CSS is not my strongest skill while developing an app, it was a fun challenge trying to 
explain and put an example on page of the different positions that can be used in CSS, 
using this information I was able to make the ListItems in the 2nd Task ( Graph ) 
look better using absolute values for the numbers.
